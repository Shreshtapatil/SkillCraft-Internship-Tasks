### Internship Task 03 ‚Äì Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier (SVM)
üíº SkillCraft Technology | üìÖ July 2025

üîó **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle ‚Äì Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data)

## üß† Project Overview
This internship task involved developing a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify images of **cats and dogs** using supervised learning. The goal was to build an accurate and efficient image classifier leveraging traditional machine learning techniques on real-world image data, focusing on feature engineering (pixel data) and effective classification.

## üóÇ Dataset
- **Classes**: `cats`, `dogs`
- Dataset includes thousands of `.jpg` images labeled by class
- Organized for training/testing using a folder-based structure:
    ```
    Your_Dataset_Root_Folder/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ training_set/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cats/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dogs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_set/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cats/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dogs/
    ```

## üìö Libraries Used
- `NumPy` ‚Äì Numerical processing, especially for image data.
- `OpenCV (cv2)` ‚Äì Efficient image loading, resizing, and grayscale conversion.
- `Matplotlib` ‚Äì Plotting and visualizing predictions.
- `scikit-learn` ‚Äì Core library for SVM model (`SVC`), data splitting (`train_test_split`), feature scaling (`StandardScaler`), and evaluation metrics (`accuracy_score`, `classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`).
- `JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook` ‚Äì Interactive development environment.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
- **Image Preprocessing:**
    - Resizing all images to a consistent `64x64` pixels.
    - Converting images to grayscale to simplify feature vectors.
    - Flattening each 2D grayscale image into a 1D feature vector.
- **Data Splitting:** The preprocessed dataset is split into training and validation sets.
- **Feature Scaling:** Pixel intensity values are standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure optimal SVM performance, as SVMs are sensitive to feature scales.
- **SVM Model:**
    - A Support Vector Classifier (`SVC`) is used.
    - The `Radial Basis Function (RBF)` kernel is chosen for its ability to handle non-linear decision boundaries.
    - Model parameters like `C` (regularization) and `gamma` (kernel coefficient) are set to default (`C=1.0`, `gamma='scale'`).
- **Training & Evaluation:**
    - The SVM model is trained on the scaled training data.
    - Performance is evaluated using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix on both validation and unseen test data.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.  **Clone this repository** (or download the files directly):
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/YourRepoName.git)
    cd YourRepoName/SCT_ML_03  # Adjust this path if your code is in a different subfolder
    ```

2.  **Ensure you have the Dataset:** Download the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle and unzip it. Make sure its structure matches the one described in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.

3.  **Find your Dataset Paths:** Note down the **absolute, full paths** to your `training_set` and `test_set` folders. For example:
    * `C:\Users\shres\Downloads\Skillcarft Tasks\SCT_ML_03\Task-3 DATASET CAT DOG\training_set\training_set`
    * `C:\Users\shres\Downloads\Skillcarft Tasks\SCT_ML_03\Task-3 DATASET CAT DOG\test_set\test_set`

4.  **Set Up Conda Environment:**
    * Open your **Anaconda Prompt (Windows)** or **Terminal (macOS/Linux)**.
    * Deactivate any active environments:
        ```bash
        conda deactivate
        ```
    * Remove any old/conflicting environments (optional but recommended for a clean start):
        ```bash
        conda env remove -n catdog_svm_env # Remove if it exists
        # ... and any other old environments you might have used previously.
        ```
    * Create a new, dedicated environment:
        ```bash
        conda create -n catdog_svm_env python=3.9
        ```
    * Activate the new environment:
        ```bash
        conda activate catdog_svm_env
        ```
        **Verify your prompt now starts with `(catdog_svm_env)`**

5.  **Install Libraries:**
    * With `catdog_svm_env` active, install the necessary packages:
        ```bash
        conda install -y numpy=1.25.2 scipy matplotlib scikit-learn opencv jupyterlab
        ```

6.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    * From your activated `catdog_svm_env` in the Anaconda Prompt/Terminal, launch Jupyter:
        ```bash
        jupyter lab
        # OR
        # jupyter notebook
        ```
    * In the Jupyter web interface, navigate to the location where you've cloned this repository (or saved the notebook file).
    * Open the notebook file named `SCT_ML_03 Code using SVM.ipynb`.
    * **Crucially, update the `train_dir` and `test_dir` variables in the first code cell of the notebook with your actual dataset paths (e.g., `train_dir = r"C:\Your\Path\To\training_set\training_set"`).** Remember the `r` for Windows paths.
    * Run all cells in the notebook sequentially (from the "Cell" menu, select "Run All").
